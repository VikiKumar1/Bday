# Best friend

* Best friend: someone whom you can be yourself with, someone who you can have pointless conversations with, someone who still likes you even when you’re weird, someone who forgets to buy you a birthday gift…that’s why I came up with this. Happy birthday my best friend!

* You may be getting older but at least I still look great!😘😘😂 😂
